this repository contains my first task in building a website with HTM
this involves using strictly html without the use of CSS.
the objective of the Task is for me to have a better understanding of the basic syntax of html
such as <head></head>, <body></body>, <h1-h6></h1-h6>, <tltle></title>, <a></a> etc
you can learn more about html tags from https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/ref_byfunc.asp
